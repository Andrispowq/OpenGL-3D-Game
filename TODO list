This file contains the list of known bugs, and things what I want to implement.
Erors that need fix:
  -in Application.cpp, the 3 functionalities from Input.h that have been implemented in Input.cpp throw unresolved external symbol link errors.
  -shader uniforms don't work yet, they cannot be uploaded to the shaders
  
TODO list:
  -Better organization of the classes
  -Implementing an Entity-Component system which I wrote in Java
  -Creating a renderer, that's better then the Java version
